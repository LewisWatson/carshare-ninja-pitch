## Take the hassle out of managing a car share

## What is Car Share Ninja?

A web application that aims to:
- Eliminate hassle of keeping track of who does what in a car share
- Simplify the decision process of who should drive next
- Be flexible while remaining fair

#HSLIDE

### Member Scoring System

Each car share member gets a score derived from the ratio of miles travelled as driver vs miles travelled as passenger

Members with the most favourable score should drive next

#VSLIDE

### Benefits of the Scoring System

By ranking members simply by the benefit they personally recieve it keeps things fair and simple

Even if members participate with varying frequency or travel different distances

#VSLIDE

This is espcecially handy in the event of
- holidays
- sick days
- differing shift patterns
- differing distances. Maybe you pick a member up on the way?
