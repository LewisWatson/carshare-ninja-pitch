### Member Scoring System

Each car share member gets a score derived from the ratio of miles travelled as driver vs miles travelled as passenger

Members with the most favourable score should drive next

#VSLIDE

### Benefits

#### Ranking members simply by the benefit they personally recieve it keeps things fair and simple

##### Even if members participate with varying frequency or travel different distances

#VSLIDE

This is espcecially handy in the event of
- holidays
- sick days
- differing shift patterns
- differing distances. Maybe you pick a member up on the way?
