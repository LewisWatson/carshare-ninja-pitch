## What is Car Share Ninja?

A web application that aims to:
- Eliminate hassle of keeping track of who does what in a car share
- Simplify the decision process of who should drive next
- Be flexible while remaining fair

### Member Scoring System
<br>
<span style="color:gray">Each car share member gets a score derived from the ratio of miles travelled as driver vs miles travelled as passenger</span>
<br>
<span style="color:gray">Member with the most favourable score should drive next</span>

#VSLIDE

### Benefits of the Scoring System
<br>
<span style="color:gray">By ranking members simply by the benefit they personally recieve it keeps things fair and simple</span>
<br>
<span style="color:gray"> Even if members participate with varying frequency or travel different distances</span>

This is espcecially handy in the event of
- holidays
- sick days
- differing shift patterns
- differing distances. Maybe you pick a member up on the way?
